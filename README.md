The name does not matter

CANNOT BE MORE STUPID.

Around 2014 I have an abstraction, as elegant as it could ever be.

```
P.ask("mod1", "mod2", ...).answer("newMod", function(mod1Result, mod2Result, ...) {
    ...
});
```

I implement it in javascript for web pages.<br/>
I implement it in lua as an addon framework for _World of Warcraft_.<br/>
I have been proud of it for years.<br/>

UNTIL I SEE REQUIREJS.

But there are still something different, I believe.

> 整体较为精致小巧，事件依赖的设计逻辑上有些许可观之处，用定时器的实现的自调度也显简明。

Also, thoughts and code fragments come to me during these years, converge into a library.

> 做了一些简化和优化，作为纪念，以及思想的一点证明。
